Assignment 1: Writing a Shell

to run my shell you first have to type: make
then type in: ./myShell 

make clean removes the objects and the myShell file

once you type ./myShell in the shell has started and will look somthing like this:
/home/abbasz/Desktop/CIS 3110/A1$ 

this is showing you what directory it currently is in. 

the rest is just user input and playing around with my shell as assignment description 

to kil the shell just click exit. 

if the wrong input or input that isn't embedded into my shell it will say "Instruction not found please enter another one"

I tried my hardest with implementing all my functions to the best of my abilities, I would say majority of function 3s implementation was my problem.
