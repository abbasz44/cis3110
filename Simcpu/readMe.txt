Assignment 2 

to run my program in the prompt you put 
>make 

then you do with the flags you would like to use 
-d stands for detailed information
-v stands for verbose mode
â€“r indicates Round Robin scheduling with the given quantum (an integer

./simcpu -d -v -r10 < input_file 

that is what it should look like with all the flags just how the description is from class 

Algorithem: 
I first set up a loop and jumped forward with each itteration and when ever the next event occurs 
the event have had many triggers that triggered other event that i put on the scheadule which I then processed 
when the time was right. 

I set up two functions one for FCFS and other for round robin 

each manily used for loops to loop through each interation to get the information
needed. 

I used brute force in the FCFS one to store the information and I sited the info that
i needed some internet help to understand the concept of the work I was doing.
