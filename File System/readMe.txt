to run my program you do:
make 
./FSreport -tree /home/abbasz/Desktop/CIS3110/A4
./FSreport -inode /home/abbasz/Desktop/CIS3110/A4

inode isnt working but it prints the nodes and other information was going to try bubble sort but kept failing, stored information in data structures like directoires namesand able to get the directories and files but unable to get the other information like read write information. 

tree function, I was able to get the infromation, but had troule with te levels, created date functions with date and time but for some reason it is getting the wrong information. Still able to get some information. but still had trouble gettinf the other information 

both tree and inode are recursive functions to keep getting the information in the proper directory 

I know this assignment isnt close to perfect but worked really hard and if I could get any part marks it would be apperciated
